###Let’s chat is self-hosted chat app for small teams or big

This tutorial will walk you through the process of adding the following :


* Build step - that will build docker image for your let’s chat app

* Push to registry step - that will push your image to docker hub

* Unit Test step - A freestyle step that runs the unit test of the demo chat after the build

* Composition step - This step will run a composition which use your chat image from the build step, docker image of curl
and check if your application is responsive. It will do so by printing "works" if a curl command to our app at port 5000 succeed.

So the first thing you need to do is :
