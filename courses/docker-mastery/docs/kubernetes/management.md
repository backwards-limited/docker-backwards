# Kubernetes Management Techniques

Behind various commands such as **create** there is a **generator** which is a template to generate stuff that you may do with a declarative yaml. We can take a look at what is generated by using a **dry run** and **output** in **yaml** e.g.

```bash
âžœ kc create deployment sample --image nginx --dry-run -o yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: sample
  name: sample
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sample
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: sample
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
status: {}
```

You could use the above as a **starting point** for creating your own **manifest**.

## Imperative vs Declarative

- Imperative: Focus on **how** a program operates e.g. **kc run, expose, scale, edit etc**
- Declarative: Focus on **what** a program should accomplish e.g. **kc apply**
